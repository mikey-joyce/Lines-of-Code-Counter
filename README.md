# Lines of Code Counter
 This algorithm traverses the filesystem tree using depth first search and finds all files of the given file extension. It will then open each file and count how many lines are in the file. At the end it will return the total number of lines of the given file extension.

# How to run this program
After downloading the executeable which is named "proj" you will want to run the following command:

```./proj (directory of choice) (file extension)```

You must give it an absolute file path in the directory of choice field. For the file extension field make sure to enter in the file extension WITHOUT the dot "." otherwise you will get an error message and the program will terminate.
